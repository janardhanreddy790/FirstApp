# FirstApp Java Application

Welcome to the FirstApp Java application! This simple application is designed to help beginners get started with Java programming by providing a basic example of a Java class and its execution.

## Overview

This application consists of a single Java class, `Main`, which contains the `main` method. When executed, the application prints "My First App" to the console.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you need to have the following installed on your system:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Make sure you have JDK 8 or higher installed. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use an open-source alternative like OpenJDK.

2. **Git**: You need Git installed to clone the repository. You can download it from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/).

3. **Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: You can use any text editor (e.g., Notepad, Sublime Text) or an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans) to write and run your Java code.

## Steps to Clone and Run the Application

Follow these steps to clone the FirstApp repository and run the application locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following command to clone the repository:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/janardhanreddy790/FirstApp.git

  ```
- If Java is installed, you will see the version information. If not, install the JDK before proceeding.

### 2. Compile the Code:
Open your terminal or command prompt in the FirstApp directory.
Run the following command to compile the code:

```shell
javac Main.java
```

This command generates a Main.class file in the same directory.

### 3. Run the Application
Execute the compiled Java class using the following command:
```shell
java Main
```
You should see the output:
```java
My First App
```


### Using IntelliJ IDEA
If you prefer to use IntelliJ IDEA to write and run your Java code, follow these steps:

Install IntelliJ IDEA: Download and install IntelliJ IDEA from the official website.

### Clone the Repository:

- ### Open IntelliJ IDEA.
  - Click on File > New > Project from Version Control.
  Select Git and paste the repository URL: https://github.com/janardhanreddy790/FirstApp.git.
  Click Clone.
- ### Open the Project:
  - IntelliJ IDEA will automatically open the cloned project.
  You should see the Main.java file in the Project view.
- ### Run the Application:
  - Click the green arrow next to the main method or right-click the Main class and select Run 'Main.main()'.
  You should see the output "My First App" in the Run window.
